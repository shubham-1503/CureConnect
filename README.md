CureConnect is a user-friendly platform bridging patients and doctors, facilitating online consultations, prescriptions, and medical history access. Patients seamlessly book appointments, view past prescriptions, and purchase prescribed medicines from available inventory, making it a comprehensive solution for healthcare needs.

This project was a collaborative effort involving a team of six individuals, including myself.

My Contributions:
- Developed a feature for patients to access past appointments, with a search filter based on the doctor’s name.
- Utilized React PDF renderer to generate prescriptions, enabling patients to view and download PDFs.
- Developed the core functionality of medicine purchase by leveraging Axios for API calls. This ensured patients could acquire prescribed medications within specified quantities, with customizable limits set by the doctor, and integrated inventory checks for availability.
- Set up the frontend with React Vite and enhanced the platform’s UX by implementing Tailwind CSS
