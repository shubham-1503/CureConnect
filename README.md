## Overview ðŸŒŸ
CureConnect is a user-friendly platform bridging patients and doctors, facilitating online consultations, prescriptions, and medical history access. Patients seamlessly book appointments, view past prescriptions, and purchase prescribed medicines from available inventory, making it a comprehensive solution for healthcare needs.

This project was a collaborative effort involving a team of six individuals, including myself.

## My Contributions ðŸš€
- Developed a feature for patients to access **past appointments**, with a **search filter** based on the doctorâ€™s name.
- Utilized **React PDF renderer** to generate prescriptions, enabling patients to **view and download PDFs**.
- Developed the core functionality of **medicine purchase** by leveraging Axios for API calls. This allowed patients to easily buy their prescribed medicines, ensuring they could order specific quantities within limits set by their doctor.
- Additionally, I integrated **inventory checks** to ensure availability, so the patient could buy medicine only if there was enough inventory.
- Designed and implemented the **Contact Us Page**, providing users with a seamless way to reach out for support and inquiries.
- Set up the frontend with **React Vite** and enhanced the platformâ€™s UX by implementing **Tailwind CSS**.
